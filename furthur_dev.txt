# Image-Search
Project Structure

Backend: Go, Redis, REST
- Use Claifai API (https://clarifai.com/developer/guide/) to analyze image and get tags
- Create Revert Index, using tag to search image url
- Store the key-value pair to redis using "Zadd" function, sort the value by ranking Value

Frontend: Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars
- Use "zrevrange" to retrive top 10 images of the tag

Further development:
1. Improve effectiveness of input words
  Rewrite Keywords, consider synonym and related words


2. Optimize ranking algorithm, more factors needed to be considered.
  Consider synonym and related words,
  make sure the tag is unique of a picture, cat one high score -> theme clear, multiple high score, theme not clear

  learn from user profile

3. challenge of potential large amout of requests:
  add load ballancer, separate read and write server, distributed system

4. batch process vs stream process
  new images are always being generated, do we need to update the database in real time?

5. frontend optimization
